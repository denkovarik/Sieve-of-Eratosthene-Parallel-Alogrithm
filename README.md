# Sieve of Eratosthene Parallel Alogrithm

## Introduction
This is a parallel program that uses the sieve of eratosthene method to find all the prime numbers less than n and display them to the screen. This program runs the sieve of eratosthene algorithm in parallel, using 8 threads, using the OpenMP library.
